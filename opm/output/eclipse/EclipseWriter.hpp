     *
     * The reservoir state can be inspected with visualization tools like
     * ResInsight.
     *
     * The summary information can then be visualized using tools from
     * ERT or ECLIPSE. Note that calling this method is only
     * meaningful after the first time step has been completed.
     *
     * The optional simProps vector contains fields which have been
     * calculated by the simulator and are written to the restart
     * file. Examples of such fields would be the relative
     * permeabilities KRO, KRW and KRG and fluxes. The keywords which
     * can be added here are represented with mnenonics in the RPTRST
     * keyword.
     *
     * By default the various solution fields like PRESSURE and
     * SWAT/SGAS should be written in single precision (i.e. as
     * float). That is what eclipse does, and probably what most third
     * party application expect - however passing false for the
     * optional variable write_float the solution fields will be
     * written in double precision.
