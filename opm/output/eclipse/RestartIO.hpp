/*
  The two loose functions RestartIO::save() and RestartIO::load() can
  be used to save and load reservoir and well state from restart
  files. Observe that these functions 'just do it', i.e. the checking
  of which report step to load from, if output is enabled at all and
  so on is handled by an outer scope.

  If the filename corresponds to unified eclipse restart file,
  i.e. UNRST the functions will seek correctly to the correct report
  step, and truncate in the case of save. For any other filename the
  functions will start reading and writing from file offset zero. If
  the input filename does not correspond to a unified restart file
  there is no consistency checking between filename and report step;
  i.e. these calls:

     load("CASE.X0010" , 99 , ...)
     save("CASE.X0010" , 99 , ...)

   will read and write to the file "CASE.X0010" - completely ignoring
   the report step argument '99'.
